Title: Correlation of obesity and food options by city population

Project Description:
Exploring the correlation between number and type of restaurants and obesity rate in the top 
300 cities by population

1. Does the amount of restaurants in a city equal a higher obesity rate (for the top 300 cities
   by population)
   - List of 300 counties by population
	Source: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.04000.001,.050000&hidePreview=true&tid=ACSDT1Y2018.B01003&vintage=2010&cid=DP05_0001E&layer=VT_2010_050_00_PY_D1&t=Populations%20and%20People&tp=true

   - Obesity rate per city (county) - rank
	Source: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html#

   - List of total number of restaurants in each city (county)
	Source: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/econ/cbp/2016-combined-report.html
   
2. Can the type of restaurant in a city be a predictor of a city's economic standing
   (Have a focus on cuisine, breakdown - Yelp API?)

3. Does a city with a higher economic standing have a lower obesity rate
   - Can use previous data sets to determine this/arrive at a conclusion

4. Is there a particular correlation between cuisine/type of restaurant and obesity
   - Can use previous data sets to determine this/arrive at a conclusion

5. Is there a correlation between economic status and cuisine 


Does the amount of restaurants in a given city equal a higher obesity rate and can restaurant 
type be a predictor of a cities economic standing?  
(Economic Standing = Do the citizens tend to be wealthier or 
worse off the national average)

Definition:  Restaurants â€“ food-serving establishments open to the public
